    Gia Fu Feng seems like the one to use - was taoist teacher, is public domain.

    1st = public domain (gia fu feng)
    2nd = not public domain
    3rd = public domain (j h mcdonald)
    4th = silly rhyme version, have no head douglass
    5th = don't charge people or change any words, and give him credit

    so mainly 1 and 3
